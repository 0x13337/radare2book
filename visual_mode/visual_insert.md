## Visual insert

The insert mode allows you to write bytes at nibble-level like most common hexadecimal editors. In this mode you can press `<tab>` to switch between the hexa and ascii columns of the hexadecimal dump.

To get back to the normal mode, just press `<tab>` to switch to the hexadecimal view and press `q`. (NOTE: if you press `q` in the ascii view...it will insert a `q` instead of quit this mode)

There are other keys for inserting and writing data in visual mode. Basically by pressing `i` key you'll be prompted for an hexpair string or use `a` for writing assembly where the cursor points.
