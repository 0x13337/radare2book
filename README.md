# R2 "Book"


## What

1. R1 book should be upgraded with R2 cmds. It should be upgraded focused only on existing essential described functionnality and not on new functionnality and removing the not supported yet old one first.
2. We should then add New functionnality and also when it is possible a small sub-chapter about HOW TO Improve a functionnality i.e : How to add a new Architecture showing source code and location.

##Â How

1. Creating a wiki entry for each r1 chapter page with a link to a socrates.io pad (to avoid duplication)
2.  Once sub-chapters r2 compliant => Commit/Push on https://github.com/Maijin/r2-book/

i.e:
    https://github.com/radare/radare2/wiki/Searching-bytes which point to => http://socrates.io/#SearchingBytes
