## History

The radare project started in February of 2006, aiming to provide a free and simple command-line interface for a hexadecimal editor with support for 64-bit offsets. The intention was to use the tool to perform searches and help recover data from hard-disks.

Since then, the project has evolved to provide a complete framework for analyzing binaries while making use of basic *NIX concepts. Those concepts include the famous "everything is a file", "small programs that interact using stdin/stdout" and "keep it simple" paradigms.

It is mostly a single-person project, but some contributions (in source, patches, ideas or specient) have been made and are really appreciated.

The central point of the project is the hexadecimal editor. This project also contains an assembler/disassembler, code analysis tools, scripting features, analysis and graphs of code and data, easy unix integration, and more.
