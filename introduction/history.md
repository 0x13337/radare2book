## History

The radare project started in February of 2006, aiming to provide a free and simple command-line interface for a hexadecimal editor supporting 64-bit offsets, to make searches and to help recovering data from hard-disks.

Since then, the project has grown with the aim changed to provide a complete framework for analyzing binaries with some basic *NIX concepts in mind, like famous "everything is a file", "small programs that interact using stdin/stdout" or "keep it simple".

It is mostly a single-person project, but some contributions (in source, patches, ideas or specient) have been made and are really appreciated.

The project is composed of a hexadecimal editor as the central point of the project with assembler/disassembler, code analysis, scripting features, analysis and graphs of code and data, easy unix integration, ...
