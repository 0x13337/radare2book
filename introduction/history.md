## History

The radare project started in February of 2006 aiming to provide a free and simple command line interface for an hexadecimal editor supporting 64 bit offsets to make searches and recovering data from hard-disks.

Since then, the project has grown with the aim changed to provide a complete framework for analyzing binaries with some basic *NIX concepts in mind like 'everything is a file', 'small programs that interact together using stdin/out' or 'keep it simple'.

It's mostly a single-person project, but some contributions (in source, patches, ideas or species) have been made and are really appreciated.

The project is composed by an hexadecimal editor as the central point of the project with assembler/disassembler, code analysis, scripting features, analysis and graphs of code and data, easy unix integration, ..
