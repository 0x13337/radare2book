## Radare2 package manager

Radare2 has its own package manager for managing external plugins (mainly from
[radare2-extras](https://github.com/radare/radare2-extras)). As most of the package managers it allows you to install, remove or update packages (plugins). There is one restriction though - currently it supports only the compilation from sources, so providing the toolchan, necessary build tools and dependencies for each plugin is the user responsibility. It might change in the future.
