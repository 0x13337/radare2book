# Chapter 2: Configuration

The core reads ~/.radare2rc while starting, so you can setup there some `e` commands to set it up in your favorite way.

To avoid parsing this file, use `-n` and to get a cleaner output for using radare in batch mode maybe is better to just drop the verbosity with `-v`.

All the configuration of radare is done with the `eval` command which allows the user to change some variables from an internal hashtable containing string pairs.

The most common configuration looks like this:

    $ cat ~/.radarerc
    e scr.color = true
    e dbg.bep   = loader
    
    
These configurations can be also defined using the `-e` flag of radare while loading it, so you can setup different initial configurations from the commandline without having to change to rc file.

    $ radare -n -e scr.color=true -e asm.syntax=intel -d /bin/ls
    
All the configuration is stored in a hash table grouped by different root names (cfg., file., dbg., ..)

To get a list of the configuration variables just type `e` in the prompt. All the basic commands can be reduced to a single char. You can also list the configuration variables of a single eval configruation group ending the command argument with a dot `.`.

There are two enhanced interfaces to help users to interactively configure this hashtable. One is called `emenu` and provides a shell for walking through the tree and change variables.

To get a help about this command you can type `e?`:

    Usage: e[?] [var[=value]]
    e?              show this help
    e?asm.bytes     show description
    e??             list config vars with description
    e               list config vars
    e-              reset config vars
    e*              dump config vars in r commands
    e!a             invert the boolean value of 'a' var
    er [key]        set config key as readonly. no way back
    ec [k] [color]  set color for given key (prompt, offset, ...)
    e a             get value of var 'a'
    e a=b           set var 'a' the 'b' value
    env [k[=v]]     get/set environment variable

       
There is a easier `e` interface accessible from the Visual mode, just typing `Ve` after entering this mode.

Most of the eval tree is quite stable, so don't expect hard changes on this area.

I encourage you to experiment a bit on this to fit the interface to your needs.


##Â 2.1 Colors

The console access is wrapped by an API that permits to show the output of any command as ANSI, w32 console or HTML (more to come ncurses, pango, ...) this allows the core to be flexible enought to run on limited environments like kernels or embedded devices allowing us to get the feedback from the application in our favourite format.

To start, we'll enable the colors by default in our rc file:

    $ echo 'e scr.color=true' >> ~/.radare2rc
You can configure the colors to be used in almost every element in your disassembly.
r2 supports rgb colors in unix terminals and allows to change the console color paletes using the `ec` command.

Type `ec` to get a list of all the palete elements.
Type `ecs` to show a color palete to pick colors from:
